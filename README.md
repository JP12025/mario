# What to Do

Towards the end of the first level of “Super Mario Bros.” released in 1985, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of bricks.
In a file named `mario.py` (Python) or `mario.jl` (Julia), implement a program that recreates this pyramid using `#` as bricks, as in the below.

```bash
$ python mario.py
Height: 8
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```

First, prompt the user for an `int` for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:

```bash
$ julia mario.jl
Height: 5
    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####
```

> [!TIP]
> To transform `str` into `int`, simply use `int()` ([Python ref](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int)).
> 
> To transform `String` into `Int`, simply use `parse()` ([Julia ref](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#Base.parse)).


Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.

```bash
$ julia mario.jl
Height: 0
Height: 3
  #
 ##
###
```

> [!TIP]
> To check that a string (`str`) contains only digits, you may use `isdigit()`. ([Doc str](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit))

# When to Do it

# How to Test

Test your script with command:
- `./check -p mario.py` if you write Python code
- `./check -j mario.jl` if you write Julia code

Don't forget it's important to test your program.
In fact, when you decide to test a program, you'll have to ask yourself questions about what your program does and what the special cases are.

What happens if the user input is :
* a negative number?
* 0 ?
* a positive number
* letters or words?
* nothing at all?

We tend to trust users' logic, but, when we write code, we have to imagine answers that don't follow any logic.

# How to Submit

Once you're done with all tasks, submit all your python files on Moodle
